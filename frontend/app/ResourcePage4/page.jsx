        <p className="">If your business carries surplus inventory, you’re not alone. Many companies accidentally over order inventory or don’t sell as much of a certain item as they thought. And sometimes, that inventory becomes surplus inventory—products that are unsellable, even over time, or materials and supplies that can no longer be used. Regardless of why your business has found itself with surplus inventory on its hands, learning how to liquidate excess inventory effectively can help your company mitigate the damage to your business’s bottom line.  </p>
        <p> In this article, we’ll define excess inventory, offer details about inventory liquidation, and walk you through how to liquidate inventory. Finally, we’ll touch on several ways your business can reduce surplus inventory in the first place through better inventory management strategies. </p>
        <p className='font-semibold'>What is excess inventory?</p>
        <p>Excess inventory is inventory your business has on hand that it does not expect to sell. This is usually because that excess inventory simply exceeds the predicted demand for the given product. You’ll know when inventory becomes excess inventory when it approaches the end of its product lifecycle, and your business is unable to sell the item as-is. </p>
        <p>Also referred to as surplus inventory, excess inventory, overstock, or B-stock; excess inventory is a liability that can cause your business all sorts of headaches, including:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
            <li className="pb-1">High carrying costs</li>
            <li className="pb-1">Reduced profit margins</li>
            <li className="pb-1">Resources wasted managing inventory that can’t be moved</li>
            <li classname="pb-1">Resources diverted from the rest of a business’s inventory management strategy </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes, businesses find themselves with surplus inventory because they’ve forecasted demand incorrectly, have mismanaged their inventory ordering processes, or do not understand what inventory they need and when. But it can also be due to unforeseen circumstances, like sudden shifts in customer behavior, economic changes, or because some unforeseeable event, such as a supply chain crisis, a natural disaster, or even a global pandemic.</p>
        <p>Regardless of why your business has found itself with surplus inventory, surplus inventory liquidation can help your company recoup some of the costs associated with excess inventory. </p>
<div>
      <p className="font-semibold pb-2">What is inventory liquidation?</p>
      <p>Inventory liquidation occurs when a business sells off inventory—almost always at a sizable discount—for cash. While liquidation can sometimes precede a business closing its doors, it can also be a way for healthy businesses to prune their inventory and build efficiency; many businesses turn to inventory liquidation to sell off excess inventory, even when the rest of the business is running smoothly. </p>
      <p>Your business can “liquidate” inventory on its own through a variety of tactics—or, in some cases, hire an inventory liquidator to handle the process for you. In today’s economy, there are plenty of ways to move surplus inventory, so take some time to consider what strategies work best for your business—and your profit margins. </p>

<div>
      <p className="font-semibold pb-2">When should inventory liquidation occur?</p>
      <p>While full-on inventory liquidation is often seen as a last resort, your business might benefit from attempting to sell off “underperforming” inventory long before the inventory becomes unsellable. This is different from when a business facing bankruptcy moves forward with a liquidation sale as part of its official filing. </p>
      <p>Remember, there is technically nothing stopping your business from liquidating any inventory at any time. The longer you hold on to inventory that your business cannot sell, the more costs you’ll incur storing, managing, and securing it. </p>

 <div>
      <p className="font-semibold pb-2">What are the goals of inventory liquidation?</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
            <li className="pb-1">Minimizing profit loss by shedding excess inventory from a business’s balance sheet</li>
            <li className="pb-1">Reimagining a business’s offerings, especially after a rebrand, merger, or pivot</li>
            <li className="pb-1">To prepare for a bankruptcy filing</li>
            <li classname="pb-1">To “clean up” a business’s inventory management strategy and prepare for better days ahead</li>
     </ul>
      
      <p>Keep in mind that “softer” inventory liquidation strategies—such as bundling and discounts—aren’t really liquidation at all, but precursors to liquidation that can help you mitigate more drastic profit losses at a later date.</p>
